**Framework Alignment:** Identity and access management for cybersecurity professionals

### User Management in Cybersecurity Context

**Identity Governance:** User management controls who can access security systems, investigation data, and administrative functions across different security team roles.

**Incident Response:** Proper user provisioning enables rapid team scaling during security incidents while maintaining access control boundaries.

**Compliance Requirements:** User management supports regulatory compliance through proper access documentation, role separation, and audit trails.

**Operational Security:** User lifecycle management reduces attack surfaces by ensuring inactive accounts are disabled and access privileges follow principle of least privilege.

## User Creation and Management

### Understanding User Types and Security Implications

Linux systems categorize users into different types based on their User ID (UID) ranges, each serving specific security purposes in enterprise environments.

**User ID Categories:**
- **UID 0:** Superuser (root) - Ultimate administrative privileges
- **UID 1-99:** System users - Core system services and daemons
- **UID 100-999:** Special purpose users - Application-specific service accounts
- **UID 1000+:** Ordinary users - Human users and security personnel

### Creating Security Team Users

**Scenario:** Provisioning new junior SOC analyst account for security operations team.

![adduser-create-user](assets/screenshots/adduser-create-user.png)

**Task:** Creating New Security Team Member
```bash
# Create new user account for junior security analyst
adduser junior

# Verify user creation and examine UID assignment
id junior
```

**Security Applications:**
```bash
# Create incident response team members
adduser ir_analyst_john
adduser forensics_specialist_sarah
adduser threat_hunter_mike

# Create service accounts for security tools
adduser --system --no-create-home splunk_service
adduser --system --no-create-home nessus_scanner
```

**Professional Application:** User creation follows security best practices including proper naming conventions, appropriate privilege levels, and documentation for audit purposes. The `adduser` command provides interactive prompts for gathering necessary user information while maintaining security standards.

### Modifying User Properties

**Scenario:** Updating user shell configuration for security tool compatibility and operational requirements.

![usermod-change-shell](assets/screenshots/usermod-change-shell.png)

**Task:** Configuring User Shell Environment
```bash
# Check current user shell configuration
getent passwd junior

# Modify user shell for security tool compatibility
usermod -s /bin/dash junior

# Verify shell change
getent passwd junior
```

**Advanced User Modifications:**
```bash
# Change user's primary group for role-based access
usermod -g security_team analyst_john

# Add user to secondary groups for tool access
usermod -aG sudo,wireshark,docker security_analyst

# Modify user's home directory location
usermod -d /opt/security/analysts/john -m analyst_john

# Set account expiration for temporary access
usermod -e 2025-12-31 contractor_analyst
```

**Security Implications:** User modifications must maintain security boundaries while enabling operational flexibility. Shell changes can affect tool compatibility, while group modifications control access to security resources and administrative functions.

### Removing Users Securely

**Scenario:** Deprovisioning departed team member while preserving investigation data for compliance and continuity.

![deluser-remove-user](assets/screenshots/deluser-remove-user.png)

**Task:** Secure User Removal Process
```bash
# Verify user exists before removal
id maria

# Remove user and home directory securely
deluser --remove-home maria

# Confirm user removal
id maria
```

**Enterprise User Removal Procedures:**
```bash
# Lock account before removal (security best practice)
usermod -L departing_analyst
passwd -l departing_analyst

# Archive user data before removal
tar -czf /backup/user_archives/departing_analyst_$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz /home/departing_analyst/

# Remove user after data preservation
deluser --remove-home departing_analyst

# Remove user from all groups
deluser departing_analyst security_team
deluser departing_analyst sudo
```

**Security Considerations:** User removal must balance security (removing access) with operational needs (preserving investigation data). Proper archival procedures ensure compliance while eliminating security risks from inactive accounts.

## Password and Account Security Management

### Implementing Account Security Controls

Password management and account security controls are essential for maintaining security in multi-user environments, especially when handling sensitive security operations and incident response activities.

### Account Locking for Security

**Scenario:** Temporarily disabling account access for security investigation or policy compliance.

![usermod-lock-user](assets/screenshots/usermod-lock-user.png)

**Task:** Implementing Account Security Controls

# Lock user account for security reasons
usermod -L anna

# Verify account lock status
passwd -S anna
```

**Security Applications:**
```bash
# Emergency account lockdown during security incident
for user in $(cat compromised_users.txt); do
    usermod -L $user
    echo "Locked account: $user"
done

# Lock unused service accounts
usermod -L backup_service
usermod -L legacy_app_user

# Implement temporary lockout for investigation
usermod -L suspected_insider_threat
```

### Account Unlocking and Recovery

**Scenario:** Restoring legitimate user access after security review or mistaken lockout.

![passwd-unlock-user](assets/screenshots/passwd-unlock-user.png)

**Task:** Account Recovery Procedures
```bash
# Unlock user account after security clearance
passwd -u angela

# Verify account unlock status
passwd -S angela
```

**Enterprise Unlock Procedures:**
```bash
# Unlock account with additional security verification
passwd -u cleared_analyst

# Reset password for additional security
passwd cleared_analyst

# Re-enable account with new security parameters
chage -d 0 cleared_analyst  # Force password change on next login
chage -M 90 cleared_analyst  # Set 90-day password expiration
```

## Group Management for Role-Based Access

### Understanding Group-Based Security

Groups enable role-based access control (RBAC) implementation, allowing security teams to manage permissions efficiently while maintaining proper separation of duties and least privilege principles.

### Creating Security Groups
