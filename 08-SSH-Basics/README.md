## Introduction to Enterprise SSH Management

### Understanding SSH in Security Operations

SSH (Secure Shell) serves as the backbone of secure remote access in cybersecurity environments. Advanced SSH configuration enables security teams to maintain secure communications, automate security operations, and provide rapid incident response capabilities while maintaining strong authentication and encryption standards.

### SSH in Cybersecurity Context

**Secure Operations:** SSH provides encrypted communication channels for SOC teams to securely access and manage security infrastructure, monitoring systems, and forensic environments.

**Incident Response:** Key-based authentication enables rapid deployment of incident response teams with secure, passwordless access to compromised systems and forensic workstations.

**Automation Security:** SSH keys facilitate secure automation of security tools, log collection, and monitoring systems without exposing sensitive credentials.

**Infrastructure Hardening:** Advanced SSH configuration reduces attack surfaces while maintaining operational efficiency for security teams and administrative access.

## Advanced SSH Key Generation

### Enhanced RSA Key Generation

**Scenario:** Generating enterprise-grade SSH keys for SOC infrastructure access and incident response operations.

![ssh-keygen-4096-rsa-generation](assets/screenshots/ssh-keygen-4096-rsa-generation.png)

**Task:** Creating High-Security SSH Key Pairs
```bash
# Generate 4096-bit RSA key pair for enhanced security
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096

# Use default location: /home/student/.ssh/id_rsa
# Set strong passphrase for key protection
```

**Advanced Key Generation for Security Teams:**
```bash
# Generate Ed25519 keys (modern, quantum-resistant)
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "soc-analyst@company.com"

# Generate RSA keys with custom naming for different roles
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/incident_response_key -C "ir-team@company.com"

# Generate ECDSA keys for legacy system compatibility
ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -f ~/.ssh/legacy_systems_key -C "legacy-access@company.com"

# Generate role-specific keys for different security functions
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/forensics_key -C "forensics@company.com"
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f ~/.ssh/siem_automation_key -C "automation@company.com"
```

**Key Security Best Practices:**
- **4096-bit RSA minimum** for new key generation
- **Ed25519 preferred** for modern implementations
- **Strong passphrases required** for all private keys
- **Role-specific keys** for different security functions
- **Regular key rotation** following security policies

### SSH Key Pair Creation Process

![ssh-keygen-key-pair-creation](assets/screenshots/ssh-keygen-key-pair-creation.png)

**Professional Key Management:**
```bash
# Verify key generation success
ls -la ~/.ssh/

# Check key fingerprints for verification
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Display key randomart for visual verification
ssh-keygen -l -v -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

# Set appropriate permissions for key files
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

## Automated SSH Key Deployment

### Understanding Secure Key Distribution

Automated key deployment enables rapid scaling of secure access for incident response teams, SOC operations, and security automation while maintaining security standards and audit trails.

### Enterprise Key Deployment

**Scenario:** Rapidly deploying SSH keys across security infrastructure for incident response team scaling and operational efficiency.

![ssh-copy-id-key-deployment](assets/screenshots/ssh-copy-id-key-deployment.png)

**Task:** Automated SSH Key Distribution
```bash
# Deploy public key to remote server automatically
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa student@server

# Authenticate with existing credentials for initial setup
# Password: student (for initial deployment only)
```

**Advanced Deployment Strategies:**
```bash
# Deploy keys to multiple security servers
for server in soc-server siem-server forensics-workstation; do
    ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/security_ops_key.pub analyst@$server
done

# Deploy role-specific keys to appropriate systems
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/incident_response_key.pub ir_analyst@compromised-server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/forensics_key.pub forensics@evidence-server
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/automation_key.pub automation@monitoring-server

# Deploy keys with custom authorized_keys file location
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/special_access_key.pub -o "AuthorizedKeysFile=/opt/security/keys/authorized_keys" admin@secure-server

# Manual deployment for restricted environments
cat ~/.ssh/security_key.pub | ssh admin@restricted-server "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```

**Deployment Security Considerations:**
- **Initial password authentication** required only for first deployment
- **Key-based authentication** replaces password access immediately
- **Proper permissions** automatically configured by ssh-copy-id
- **Audit logging** of key deployment activities

### SSH Key Authentication Verification

**Scenario:** Verifying successful key-based authentication deployment and testing secure access for security operations.

![ssh-key-based-authentication-test](assets/screenshots/ssh-key-based-authentication-test.png)

**Task:** Authentication Testing and Verification
```bash
# Test key-based authentication
ssh student@server

# Verify passwordless authentication (key-based only)
# Enter passphrase to unlock private key if configured
```

**Comprehensive Authentication Testing:**
```bash
# Test different key-based connections
ssh -i ~/.ssh/incident_response_key ir_analyst@compromised-server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/forensics_key forensics@evidence-server
ssh -i ~/.ssh/automation_key automation@siem-server

# Verify authentication method used
ssh -v student@server 2>&1 | grep -i "authentication"

# Test key agent forwarding for multi-hop access
ssh -A analyst@bastion-server
ssh forensics@internal-server  # From bastion server

# Check authorized_keys configuration on remote server
ssh student@server "cat ~/.ssh/authorized_keys | wc -l"
```

## Host Key Management and Security

### Understanding Host Key Verification

Host key management provides protection against man-in-the-middle attacks and ensures the integrity of SSH connections in security-critical environments. Proper host key management is essential for maintaining trust in security infrastructure.

### Known Hosts Security Management

**Scenario:** Managing host key changes and security warnings during infrastructure updates or potential security incidents.

![ssh-host-key-warning-known-hosts](assets/screenshots/ssh-host-key-warning-known-hosts.png)

**Host Key Security Analysis:**
- **Host key changes** may indicate server reinstallation, key regeneration, or potential security compromise
- **MITM attack detection** through host key verification failures
- **Security investigation** required when unexpected host key changes occur
- **Authorized key updates** following verified infrastructure changes

**Host Key Management Commands:**
```bash
# Remove specific host key from known_hosts
ssh-keygen -f "/home/student/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "server"

# Add new host key after verification
ssh-keyscan -H server >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Display host key fingerprints for verification
ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

# Verify host key against known good fingerprint
ssh-keygen -l -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts | grep server
```

**Enterprise Host Key Management:**
```bash
# Bulk host key verification for security infrastructure
for host in soc-server siem-server forensics-server; do
    echo "Checking $host..."
    ssh-keyscan -H $host >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts_new
done

# Compare host keys for security validation
diff ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts_backup

# Update known_hosts with verified infrastructure changes
ssh-keygen -R old-server
ssh-keyscan -H new-server >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts

# Backup known_hosts for security baseline
cp ~/.ssh/known_hosts ~/.ssh/known_hosts_$(date +%Y%m%d)
```

**Security Investigation Procedures:**
When host key warnings occur, security teams should:
1. **Verify infrastructure changes** with system administrators
2. **Check security logs** for unauthorized access attempts
3. **Validate server authenticity** through out-of-band verification
4. **Document key changes** for security audit trails
5. **Update monitoring systems** with new host key information
